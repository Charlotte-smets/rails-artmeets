Artmeets is a Progressive Web Application, generated with the framework Ruby on Rails. It was made by three students from Le Wagon : Charlotte Smets, Mohammad Ewaz and Cl√©ment Azalbert.

The objective of Armeets is to put artists and gallerists in relation to create new collaborations and create a strong artistic community.

The way Artmeets works is much like the dating application Tinder. On one side you have the gallerists and on the other the artists. Both users can use filters to access either some artworks (user = gallerist) or some gallerists profiles (user = artist).

One the filters are choosen the user can start swiping. If the user is a gallerist, he/she can swipe throught some artists' artworks and on the other side if he/she is an artist he/she can swipe throught gallerists profiles. They can either swipe left to dislike the artwork (or the gallerist's profile) or swipe right to like the artwork (or the gallerist's profile).

If both a gallerist and a artist liked each other, it creates a match between the two protagonists. Then, they can see more details of their respective profiles and if they want  start talking throught a private chatroom.
